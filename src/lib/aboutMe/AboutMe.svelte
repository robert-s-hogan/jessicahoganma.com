        <p class="py-4">Hi, my name is Claudia and I work remotely as a <span class="font-bold">freelance data analyst/scientist</span>. I hold a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in science (Business Analytics, VU University Amsterdam).</p>
        <p class="py-4">Since I was young, I have always enjoyed to solve puzzles. So that’s how I look at big data sets: to me it is one big puzzle I want to solve. Finding patterns nobody else sees is the challenge to me.</p>
        <p class="py-4">Before I started as a freelancer, I had worked for more than eight years as a data analyst in consulting and retail. I have worked for more than 25 companies which gives me the ability to translate complex questions into understandable insights.</p>
        <p class="py-4">Do you want to work together? Please reach out to me by e-mail.</p>
